- 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding all functions of a computer well. However, I do believe that specialization increase the quality of a product and we owe much of the modern world to this principle. Thus, I am also passionate about using specialized high-level technologies to design great products.
